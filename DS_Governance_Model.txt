Design System Governance Model

1. Designs must serve more than one solution unless it better serves the user experience

2. Designs must not contradict existing patterns unless broad updates are made to reflect these new patterns throughout the design system

3. Designs must be communicated to all individuals who use the design system

4. Tuffy the Titan may ignore the guidelines if he wants to contribute to the design system
